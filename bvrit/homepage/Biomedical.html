      <p class="">Biomedical engineering (BME) is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes. This field seeks to close the gap between engineering and medicine, combining the design and problem-solving skills of engineering with medical biological sciences to advance health care treatment, including diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy.</p>
      <p class="">Biomedical engineers use and apply an intimate knowledge of modern biological principles in their engineering design process. Aspects of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science and engineering, materials science, mathematics, etc. are all integrated with human biology in biomedical engineering to improve human health, whether it is an advanced prosthetic limb or a low-cost medical device.</p>
      <p class="">There are many subdisciplines within biomedical engineering, including the design and development of active and passive medical devices, orthopedic implants, medical imaging, biomedical signal processing, tissue engineering, and clinical engineering, just to name a few.</p>
