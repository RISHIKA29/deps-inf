      <p>Electrical and Electronics Engineering in BVRIT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department in BVRIT, established in 1997 with an intake of 40.</li>
        <li>Increased intake to '60' in the year 2001 and to '120' in the year 2012. </li>
        <li>Granted provisional accreditation for Three years for the period 10.02.2009 to 10.02.2012.</li>
        <li>Granted provisional accreditation for Two years for the period 08.11.2013 to 08.11.2015.</li>
        <li>Granted provisional accreditation for Three years for the period 01.05.2017 to 01.05.2020.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Intake</p>
      <ul>
        <li>B.Tech-Electrical and Electronics Engineering-120</li>
        <li>M.Tech-Electrical Power Systems-18</li>
        <li>M.Tech-Power Engineering and Energy Systems-18</li>
      </ul>
    <p>There are many subdisciplines within biomedical engineering, including the design and development of active and passive medical devices, orthopedic implants, medical imaging, biomedical signal processing, tissue engineering, and clinical engineering, just to name a few.</p>
    <p>The Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, has been so structured, in terms of experienced staff and excellent laboratory facilities, as to equip the students with knowledge of cutting edge technologies and provide them adequate hands-on experience through laboratory work, innovative projects in Industry and Research Establishments, seminars/workshops and so on.</p>
    <p>Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) has long played a critical role in undergirding innovations that improve the quality of life, support economic growth, and address societal problems.  Its emergence as a separate field of study in the late 19th century paralleled, and was responsive to, the large-scale introduction of telegraphy and electrical lighting. Electrical engineering has continued to play a pivotal role in power and energy distribution, communications, and computation, even as the power-carrying channels have evolved from heavy metal cables to nano wires or optical fibers; the networks of communications have evolved from wires to wireless to neurons; and the basic electrical switches have evolved from vacuum tubes to transistors to carbon nano-tubes.  The essential technologies that connect society: mobile phones, laptops, wireless communications, downloaded videos, light-emitting diodes, electronic displays, “smart” power grids, and rapidly evolving systems for monetary transactions are all evidence of the impact of innovation in electrical engineering.</p>
