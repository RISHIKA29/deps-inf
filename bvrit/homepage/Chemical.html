      <p>Chemical Engineering is one of the oldest and most popular engineering sub-domains that exist in the physical sciences. Also referred to by many experts as Applied Chemistry, this field deals with the transformation of raw materials into more useful and valuable forms by application of physical sciences (physics & chemistry) as well as (microbiology, biochemistry & biology) and mathematics. In simpler terms, Chemical Engineers are involved in designing, construction, and operating machinery and plants to perform a variety of chemical reactions on raw materials to give them the shape of more useful substances. One of the most common examples of chemical engineering products that we use in our daily life includes petroleum products, cosmetics, plastic, and many more. Considering the vast impact of this subject on the things that we use and employ in our day-to-day life, chemical engineering offers excellent career opportunities to students.</p>
