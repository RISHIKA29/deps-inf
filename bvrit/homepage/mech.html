      <p>The department of Mechanical Engineering was established in B. V. Raju Institute of Technology (BVRIT) in the year 2009 with an intake of 60 students, subsequently, which has been enhanced to 120 students from the academic year 2012-2013. M.Tech in Engineering Design started in the year 2014 with an annual intake of 18 students.</p>
      <p>The Mechanical Engineering department at BVRIT is well equipped and has amenities with the latest state-of-the-art laboratories and manned by highly qualified & experienced faculty members. The students are trained in the latest versions of mechanical software packages like AutoCAD, ANSYS, Solid Works, Solid Edge, FEMAP, Pro/ENGINEER 4.0, Master CAM, FLUENTetc. There are also special-purpose machines like CNC Lathe and CNC Milling.</p>
      <p>The department of Mechanical Engineering has experienced faculty in the areas of Design, Thermal, Production, and Industrial engineering, i.e., the major areas of Mechanical Engineering. They have published a good number of research papers in refereed International / National Journals and International / National Conferences. Faculty published papers in peer-reviewed international journals such as ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) Journal of Heat Transfer, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer (Elsevier, UK), an International JETEAS Journal the UK and International ARPN Journal, etc.</p>
      <p>A major effort of the department is directed towards the creation of an intellectual environment in which undergraduate students can develop to their maximum potentials. Faculty members encourage undergraduate students to participate in both fundamental and applied research. Students have excellent opportunities to participate actively in the classroom and laboratories and to follow special interests within a subject area. Hence we provide students with the foundational skills needed to understand, exploit, and enhance the mechanical behavior of advanced engineering devices and systems, and to make creative contributions at the forefront of the field.</p>
      <p>The department has adopted the latest teaching-learning processes like e-learning, google apps, PowerPoint presentations, seminars, industrial visits, expert Lectures from Industry and academia Personnel, etc. We take special efforts to reduce the gap between Industry & Institute by arranging internships during semester breaks or summer in companies such as Nissan Ashok Leyland, BHEL, Visakhapatnam Steel plant, NTPC, Bakelite Hylam, ONGC, Research Centre Imarat (RCI), Ordinance Factory, Sundaram Clayton Limited, Schneider Electric, Anjani Portland Cements, SAMKRG Pistons, NATCO Pharma and Aurobindo Pharma Limited, etc. </p>
